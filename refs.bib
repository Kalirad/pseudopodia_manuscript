We have analysed this process, and our findings support a much more dynamic view than previously described. We apply time-lapse microscopy coupled to single-cell molecular analyses in human hematopoietic stem cells and find that fate decision is not a unique, programmed event but a process of spontaneous variation and selective stabilisation reminiscent of trial--error processes. We show that each cell explores (at its own pace and independently of cell division) many different possibilities before reaching a stable combination of genes to be expressed. Our results suggest, therefore, that multipotency seems to be more like a transitory state than a feature of a specific cell category.},

@article{Kupiec1997aa,
	Abstract = {In this theory, cell differentiation is a two-step mechanism at each stage of development. In the first step, gene expression is unstable. It occurs stochastically and produces different cell types. In the second step gene expression is stabilized by means of cellular interactions. However, this stabilization cannot occur until the combination of cell phenotypes corresponding to the developmental stage is expressed. This selection mechanism prevents disorganizing consequences of stochasticity in gene expression and directs the embryo towards the adult stage. Instability and stochasticity in gene expression are caused by random displacement of regulators along DNA, whereas phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation of transcriptional regulators triggered by signal transduction between cells are responsible for the stabilization of stochastic gene expression. The origin of cellular differentiation is explained as an adaptation of cells to metabolic gradients created by substrate diffusion inside growing cell populations. This mechanism provides cells with complementary metabolism, increasing their ability to use food resources. Because the metabolic gradients are dependent on external substrate concentrations, cellular differentiation can also be viewed as an extension of natural selection inside organisms.},

@article{Schluter2016,
	Abstract = {Author Summary Bacteria secrete signal molecules into their environment and use these to regulate many of their key phenotypes. This is called quorum sensing and it is thought to evolve because it allows cells to sense their density. Here we propose a new function for quorum sensing that sheds light on its evolution. We develop a realistic model of a bacterial community and show that quorum sensing can function as a way to outcompete neighbors in patches occupied by many different genotypes. Growing aggressively at first makes quorm sensing genotypes a match for competitors. This strategy allows them to surround themselves with clonemates before reallocating resources to costly traits like cooperative secretions. This works because quorum sensing can act as a timer, which cells can use to infer how related they are to their neighbours and tune their investment into costly and exploitable cooperation based on the threat of competition from unrelated genotypes.},

@article{Hooshangi2011,
	Abstract = {Author Summary Quorum sensing is a mechanism by which bacterial cells communicate within a population. One particular form of communication in E. coli is through a universal signaling molecule known as autoinducer 2. Although the importance of this form of cell-cell interaction has been recognized in the formation of biofilms and virulent infections, the mechanisms by which this form of communication is regulated is still not well understood. In this paper, we presented a method of unraveling these mechanisms by using a combination of experimental work and mathematical models. We took apart the network architecture and isolated the different components. The examination of these isolated sub-networks provided us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control and regulate bacterial quorum sensing. We were also able to predict new network interactions with the help of our mathematical models. This bottom up approach, combined with our modeling efforts, proved effective in unraveling the mechanisms of quorum sensing in E. coli.},

	N2 = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

	N2 = {Clonal populations of cells exhibit substantial phenotypic variation. Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

Several such determinants have been identified in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the molecular machinery responsible for their asymmetric segregation is beginning to be unraveled. To divide asymmetrically, cells establish an axis of polarity, orient the mitotic spindle along this axis and localize cell fate determinants to one side of the cell. During cytokinesis, determinants are then segregated into one of the two daughter cells where they direct cell fate. Here, we outline the steps and factors that are involved in this process in Drosophila and C. elegans and discuss their potential conservation in vertebrates.},

@article{Nadell2009,
	Abstract = {Biofilms are densely packed communities of microbial cells that grow on surfaces and surround themselves with secreted polymers. Many bacterial species form biofilms, and their study has revealed them to be complex and diverse. The structural and physiological complexity of biofilms has led to the idea that they are coordinated and cooperative groups, analogous to multicellular organisms. We evaluate this idea by addressing the findings of microbiologists from the perspective of sociobiology, including theories of collective behavior (self-organization) and social evolution. This yields two main conclusions. First, the appearance of organization in biofilms can emerge without active coordination. That is, biofilm properties such as phenotypic differentiation, species stratification and channel formation do not necessarily require that cells communicate with one another using specialized signaling molecules. Second, while local cooperation among bacteria may often occur, the evolution of cooperation among all cells is unlikely for most biofilms. Strong conflict can arise among multiple species and strains in a biofilm, and spontaneous mutation can generate conflict even within biofilms initiated by genetically identical cells. Biofilms will typically result from a balance between competition and cooperation, and we argue that understanding this balance is central to building a complete and predictive model of biofilm formation.},
